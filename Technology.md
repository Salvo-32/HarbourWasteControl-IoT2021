
A separate mark-down document in the repository (called "Technology") 
providing details on the technical aspects of the product/service, 
including a high-level presentation of the conceptual architecture of the software and hardware components that make up the product/service, 
a description of the main software/hardware components (e.g., 1 paragraph for each component), 
how these components interact (e.g., network protocols, APIs used), 
a network architecture clearly depicting the IoT elements, Edge components, Cloud components, End-user components. 

hardware needed foreach unit of the network
quay sensors: Torbidity sensor + ph meter + proximity sensor
on board sensors: proximity sensor +  

quay connection: local wi-fi/low range radio transmission + LoRa(?)
on board connection: local wi-fi/low range radio transmission
